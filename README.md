# Quaternary Calculator Group 9

## Project Overview
This project is a calculator designed to perform arithmetic operations on quaternary (base-4) numbers. The calculator supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of quaternary numbers. It also allows users to toggle the display between quaternary and decimal (base-10) number systems.

## Features
- **Basic Arithmetic Operations:** Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of quaternary numbers.
- **Dual Display:** Toggle between quaternary and decimal representations of numbers.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Designed to resemble a traditional calculator with only four number buttons (0, 1, 2, 3).
- **Separate UI and Logic:** Clean separation between the user interface and the business logic, allowing for maintenance and testing.

## Installation
### Prerequisites
- **Java Development Kit (JDK) 12 or higher**
- **IntelliJ IDEA**

### Setup Instructions
1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/quaternary-calculator.git
   cd quaternary-calculator
   ```

2. **Open in IntelliJ:**
    - Open IntelliJ.
    - Select **Open** and navigate to the cloned repository.
    - IntelliJ will automatically detect and import the project.

3. **Build the Project:**
    - Ensure that the correct JDK (12) is configured.
    - Build the project using the Build menu or by pressing `Ctrl+F9`.

4. **Run the Application:**
    - Use the `Run` option in IntelliJ IDEA to start the calculator.

## Usage
### Basic Operations
1. **Enter a Quaternary Number:** Click on the digits (0, 1, 2, 3) to form a quaternary number.
2. **Select an Operation:** Click on one of the operation buttons (+, -, *, /).
3. **Enter the Second Number:** Enter another quaternary number.
4. **View the Result:** Press the `=` button to display the result.
5. **Toggle Display Mode:** Use the toggle button to switch between quaternary and decimal views.

### Example
- **Operation:** 12 (quaternary) + 21 (quaternary)
- **Result:** The result in quaternary is `33`, which equals `15` in decimal.
